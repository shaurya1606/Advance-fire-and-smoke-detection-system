# Fire and Smoke Detection using CNN and Computer Vision

## Overview
This project aims to create a fire and smoke detection model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and computer vision techniques. The model identifies fire and smoke from images and sends alerts to ensure safety in monitored areas. The system is designed for real-time fire detection, useful in environments such as campus surveillance systems.
